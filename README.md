# Linked List Implementation

### Overview
A custom singly linked list implemented from scratch in C++.  
Includes node insertion, deletion, traversal, counting, and duplicate removal.

---

### Features
- Core operations:  
  - `pushFront()` / `pushBack()`  
  - `deleteItem()` / `contains()`  
  - `countItem()` / `removeDuplicates()`  
- Destructor for proper memory cleanup  
- Overloaded output stream (`<<`) for display

### Example
```bash
List: 5 -> 10 -> 10 -> 15 -> nullptr
Size: 4
After removeDuplicates: 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> nullptr
